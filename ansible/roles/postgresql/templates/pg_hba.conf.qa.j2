# Example:
# 
# host <database>      <user>    <auth type>

# If you change this first entry you will need to make sure that the
# database superuser can access the database using some other method.
# Noninteractive access to all databases is required during automatic
# maintenance (custom daily cronjobs, replication, and similar tasks).

# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
