<img src="assets/help/images/help_setup_logout.png" alt="Help-setup-logout.">

<p>On the right are 3 icons that represent Help, Setup, and Logout respectively from left to right.  Help should
  bring you to this document.  Logout should bring you back to the login screen.  The setup icon takes you to a new
  page that allows you to configure your account. We will discuss the setup page the next section.</p>

<img src="assets/help/images/view_menu.png" alt="view_menu">
<p>On the left side of the screen you will see a menu of different ways to view the messages.  At the top of that
section is a blue button called "New Post."  This button allows posting thread posts to the system that are shared
with the rest of the course or group.  Thread posts start a new topic of conversation.  Once a topic is seen,
replies can be created by other course members or the thread post topic can be voted on.  These tools are
  discussed in other places in these help files. </p>
<p>The next view is "Home".  This is the view we are currently discussing.  This button allows the return back
the the home page from most other places in the site.</p>
<p>The "Starred" view lists the posts that have been marked as starred.  A post can be stared by pressing the
  red star button next to a post.</p>
<img src="assets/help/images/reply_icons.png" alt="reply icons">
  <p>Starring can be used to mark any particularly useful posts that you don't want to get lost in
the clutter of a course.</p>
<p>The next item is "Drafts".  Posts that are not quite ready to be seen by the course can be stored in a draft
folder from the posting page.  These posts can be found here. </p>
<p>The instructors and TAs can mark an important post as an announcements.  These posts stand out and show up here so
they can be found easily.</p>
<p>"Unread" posts are the posts that you have not seen yet.  This is just a little faster way to get to the unseen posts
than may be seen from the home screen which includes the posts that have already been read.</p>
<p>"Search" leads to a page that allows the selection of criteria that can be used to find posts or group posts
accordingly.</p>
<p> At the bottom of this menu you will find the list of courses you are enrolled and have active. The currently selected
  course is marked with a green checkbox.  Only posts from the currently selected course are
shown from the menu items above.  </p>
<img src="assets/help/images/main_page.png" alt="main_page">
<p>The main section of the home displays the current list of course messages.  From the "Home" view this shows almost
every posting thread that is available in the selected course including instructor announcements and threads from any
groups that you are a member.</p>
<img src="assets/help/images/message_types.png" alt="message_types">
These are the primary post icon types.  From left to right they are "Question Post", "Note Post", "Announcement Post",
and "Poll post".  Question posts are used to ask questions.  Note posts are just information that is put out there.
Announcements post are created by the instructors and TAs for important information.  Poll posts allow the course users
to vote on different items.  All of these are created using the "New Post" button on the home screen.
<img src="assets/help/images/reply_icons.png" alt="reply icons">
<p>These actions can be performed on a specific post.  Form left to right they are "Starring", "Replying", "Editing", and
"Deleting".  You can star a post and it will show up in the starred view on the homepage.  You can reply to any thread
  post. You can only edit your own posts. Typically, you can only delete your own posts too.  </p>
