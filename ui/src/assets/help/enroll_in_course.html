<p> The courses tab allows you to enroll in a course.  You will need a course key which should have been provided
  by your instructor or institution.  When you have this, you can click the blue “Enroll in Course” button.  This will
  pull up a popup page where you can enter the key. </p>

<p>Once you have entered the key, press ok and you should be signed up for your new course.  It is worth noting that
  if the icon below the Show Course On Dashboard column is a red x, you will not be able to interact with the course.
  You will need to click the corresponding icon on the Add/Remove from Dashboard column until the x becomes a green
  check mark under Show Course On Dashboard.  This functionality allows you to hide old courses to reduce the clutter
  on your system.  After you have completed this process you should see the new course listed on the bottom left
  of the home page.</p>
