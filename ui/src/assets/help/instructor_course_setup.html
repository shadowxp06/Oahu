<p>The setup icon is a red wrench that can be found in the lower left on the home screen where the active courses
  are listed.  It looks like:</p>

<p>You will need to be an Instructor or TA to see the configuration icon for a course.  If no courses are listed here
  you may need to enable the course.  See the users manual for instructions on how to do that.  Once you have clicked
  on the red wrench, you should see a screen that looks like this.</p>

<p>Here you may manage the selected course.
  The basic screen as shown above allows changing the course description.  Type a new description and click submit.

<p>Other course settings can be changed on the next tab:</p>

<p>Anonymous Posts allow students to post without other students seeing their user information.  This can be enabled
  and disabled with the first toggle.<br>
  Groups allow the creation of a smaller forum for users to meet.  An example of how groups might be used it to create
  a lab1 group such that students are only able to see the posts of other students in lab1 but not the posts of
  students in lab2.  Setting up groups is discussed when we get to the groups tab.  If the “Allow students to create
  their own groups” toggle is enabled, students can use the group system as well.<br>
  The like system is a way for posts to be ranked with user votes in a similar way to stackoverflow or slashdot.
  Students can use the system to organize useful information quickly.  This system works by allowing a student to
  “upvote” a particular post which increases its rank.  Posts which many student upvotes will have a high rank and
  searches can use this information to organize the posts.  The Disallow Upvote toggle will turn this system on and
  off.<br>
  The default threads selection at the bottom of the tab applies to the course and is only a recommended setting.
  Students and other users can override it with their own settings.  This is basically how many posts are shown on
  a page at one time.<br>
  Any changes here will require the “Submit” button for them to become effective.

<p>The Participation tab shown above allows Instructors to export post to manipulate outside of the system.  This can
  be used to evaluate student performance and may be useful for other tasks.</p>
<img src="assets/help/images/inst_course_enrollment_tab.png" alt="The Inst course enrollment tab.">
<p>The Enrollment tab can be used to modify the start and end date of a course.  Users will be unable to add new posts
  outside of this date range.  The Enrollment Key is a tool to allow students to self enroll in a course.  This key
  can be emailed to a student and used by the student to enroll themselves in the course.  It is shown here for
  convenience but cannot be altered once the course has been setup.<br>
  Access control can be used to promote a student to TA status granting them additional permissions for the system
  in the course.  TAs can create groups and modify some course settings and well as have unique tools they
  can use to monitor the students and assist the Instructor.  Using the Promote to TA/ Demote from TA icon allows
  the instructor to assign TAs.

<p>The final tab allows the creation user groups and the assignment of users to them.  Use the blue “Add Group” button
  to create a new group.  This pulls up a subpage that allows the group name to be entered.</p>
<img src="assets/help/images/enter_group_name.png" alt="Enter group name.">
<p>Use the blue plus icon to add new members to the group.  This pulls up a subpage that allows the selection of the
  members to add.</p>
<img src="assets/help/images/add_group_member.png" alt="Add Group Member.">
<p>By clicking on the “Select User(s)” section members of the group can be added.  Clicking the red trashbin will
  delete a user from the group. <br>
  Groups themselves cannot be deleted if there are still posts within them.  All posts must be moved or deleted from the group first.
