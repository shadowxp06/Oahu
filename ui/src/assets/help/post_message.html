<p>You can get to the post message page by clicking on the "New Post" button from the home page. </p>
<img src="assets/help/images/post_message.png" alt="reply icons">
<p>First select the course you would like to post the thread to.  Next type a title for the thread.</p>
<p>This page allows you to select a message type.  Question threads ask a question, Note threads send a message,
and poll threads allow users to vote on topics.</p>
<p>Once you have selected the type of post you want, you just type it into the body of the page just below
all of the formating icons.  You can use these icons to change the appearance of the message.  These formatting
  icons work the same as they do in most word processing programs.</p>
